# ThistleMapEditor
Map editor for Thistle
This is going to be the editor for making maps for Thistle, it's still under development as the idea for the game keeps changing, but feel free to check out what we have so far. The map editor uses a TUI because the art for the game is still pretty under development, also it's easier to make a good editor in Lanterna rather than LibGDX.

This uses the Lanterna and Jsoup libraries for graphics and editing/reading map files
