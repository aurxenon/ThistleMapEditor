# ThistleMapEditor
Map editor for Thistle


This is the Thistle map editor, it's still under heavy development as the games ideas keep changing, but feel free to check out what we've made so far, the map editor uses a TUI since the art for the game is still under development, plus it's easier than making one in Swing or LibGDX.

The Lanterna library is used for graphics and the Jsoup library is used for editing/reading map data.
